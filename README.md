# Readme
<b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of this code is to analyze option SPY data and plot it. This was useful, when I was playing around with the data before building a database. The option trading data is not included. The same format could be useful for others, though. 

<b>Why is it Public?:</b> I wanted to back up my code, but a private github account is $7/month. The code might be useful for someone analyzing large amounts of option data. This doesn't pose any security risk because it is not currently being used by anyone. 

<b>Installation:</b> Simply download the notebook SPXdataNotebook.ipynb and run it. The other notebooks contain less clean/even more messy code.
