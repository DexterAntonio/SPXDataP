# Readme
<b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of this code is to analyze option trading data and plot it. The option trading data is not included. The same format could be useful for others, though. 

<b>Why is it Public?:</b> I wanted to back up my code, but a private github account is $7/month. The code might be useful for someone analyzing large amounts of option data. This doesn't pose any security risk because it is not currently being used by anyone. 
Installation: Simply download the notebook
